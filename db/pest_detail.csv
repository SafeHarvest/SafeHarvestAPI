Ambrosia Beetles: {\description\ => \Larva - White, legless, slightly curved, up to 4 mm long. Ambrosia Beetles, {\description\ => \Larva - White, legless, slightly curved, up to 4 mm long. Adult female- Dark reddish-brown beetle about 3 mm long. Adult male - Wingless beetle about 1.5 mm long.\, \destructiveStage\=> \Leaves - Sudden wilting and death; delayed emergence in spring. Branches - 1.5 mm-wide tunnels through bark into heartwood (shothole borer does not tunnel into wood) in a circular or cork-screw pattern with the rings; wood shows purple stain extending from tunnels due to fungus released by the adult beetles. Severely infested branches can break easily due to gusty winds or fruit load. Trunk - Tunneling into trunks of young trees can weaken trunks to the point they can break.\, \symptoms\ => \Look for small entry or exit holes (2mm). Sawdust at the entry of tunnels indicates recent attacks by adults. Sticky material on tree trunks may help detect adults. Use ethanol-baited funnel traps (2 to 4 traps/acre) to monitor adults in the spring. Control beetles if more than 20 beetles are caught /trap/season.\, \care\ => \Cultural - It is important to maintain optimum tree vigor as ambrosia beetles are attracted to trees weakened due to drought, flooding, transplanting, disease, winter and mechanical injury. In areas prone to sun or winter damage, paint trunks with a solution of equal parts of latex paint and water to prevent damage to trees. Do not store wood with bark near orchards as it can remain a source of ambrosia beetles for up to a year. Remove and promptly burn or chip beetle-infested trees or limbs. If the wood cannot be burned, chipped or otherwise destroyed, cover the wood with plastic to prevent beetles from attacking the wood or escaping if already infested. To intercept female beetles flying into an orchard (males do not fly), place bundles of three or four 1- to 2-metre long hardwood logs (harvested the previous year) at 10-20 metre intervals along borders adjacent to deciduous (hardwood) trees. Puncture the bark several times to improve release of odors attractive to the beetles. Destroy the trap logs before new adults appear. Chemical - Endosulfan (Thiodan or Endosulfan) applied for control of aphids in the spring will also control any active adult beetles.\, \photourl\ => \ \}
Apple Maggot: {\description\ => \Adult=> Adults are about 5 mm long, slightly smaller than a house fly, black body with yellowish head and legs, and green eyes. Wings have black bands, which are used to identify this pest from related fruit flies (Figs. 1 & 3). Larva=> White, legless, maggot-like with no distinct head, about 6.5-8 mm long when mature (Fig. 2). Pupa=> About 5 mm long, gold to brown colour, oval shape. This description of the apple maggot life cycle is based on information from Washington State University1 which should be very similar to that of apple maggot populations in the Lower Mainland. The pest overwinters as pupae under host trees. Adult flies begin to emerge in late June to early July and continue to emerge until early October. A small percentage of flies may not emerge for 2-3 years. Adults require 7-10 days to feed (aphid honeydew, bird droppings, other plant/insect exudates) and become sexually mature in order to mate and lay eggs. Females are attracted to ripening fruit to lay eggs and will move between hosts as the fruit ripens. This also applies to apple varieties that ripen at different times. Each female can lay a total of up to 500 eggs over its life time of 2-4 weeks. Eggs are laid singly just under the skin and hatch in 3-7 days. The larvae (maggots) burrow through the fruit before maturing in 13-50 days, depending on temperature. Mature larvae leave the fruit, usually after it has dropped to the ground, and burrow into the soil to overwinter. Any larvae in unharvested fruit in the fall are not likely to survive the winter.\, \destructiveStage\=> \Small dimples and depressions will appear where females insert their eggs under the skin of the fruit (Fig. 4). Apples infested early in the season will appear bumpy as they mature. Larval feeding damage appears as distinctive brown tunnels meandering through the flesh of the fruit (Figs. 5-7). Heavily infested fruit can become mushy and prematurely drop. In storage, even low levels of infestation can result in rotted fruit.\, \symptoms\ => \\, \care\ => \Chemical control for apply one of the products listed in Table 1 within 7 days of first fly capture and repeat at intervals as recommended on the product label (usually every 10-14 days). It is important to keep fruit protected as long as flies are captured. If no flies are captured within 14 to 21 days after first fly capture, do not treat again until the next fly is captured. If flies are only captured in perimeter traps, the insecticide need only be applied to the outer 2–4 rows where the flies were captured. Insecticides applied against second generation codling moth in late July and August will give protection against apple maggot for 10–14 days depending on the product. It is important to consider the pre-harvest intervals when selecting a control product because the application will be made as the fruit nears maturity, the favored time for apple maggot attack. Read and carefully follow label instructions. Non-chemical control remove any unmanaged, wild or unsprayed trees within 500 m of an orchard to eliminate outside sources of apple maggots. Inspect orchard regularly for signs of apple maggot infestation and fallen apples, especially along margins nearest backyard or wild host trees. Infested fruit should be destroyed or buried >30 cm before the larvae leave the fruit to hibernate in the soil. Research in Quebec5 has demonstrated that baited sticky red spheres or yellow panels with center red sphere hung at 10 m intervals along the margins of non to low infested orchards will protect the orchard by intercepting females immigrating from nearby infested sources. This tactic is called perimeter trapping. Similar results have been demonstrated in New England using insecticide-treated spheres. However this control tactic has not been investigated thoroughly in western North America. Do not store fruit bins under host trees to avoid risk of contaminating the bins with larvae or pupae and risk spreading the pest to non-infested areas. Empty bins should not be returned to non-infested areas unless pressure-washed to remove any larvae or pupae. For non-commercial growers with only a few trees, bagging individual fruit or bagging whole trees is possible and effective. The Seattle Tree Fruit Society has instructions on how to thin fruit at a very early stage and apply the mesh bags in one operation. Tree covers produced by a B.C. company for Rhagoletis flies will also protect apple trees.\, \photourl\ => \ \}
Apple Clearwing Moth: {\description\ => \\, \destructiveStage\=> \\, \symptoms\ => \\, \care\ => \\, \photourl\ => \\}
Aphids: {\description\ => \Egg - Oval, shiny black. Immature - Dark green with black legs, wingless. Adult - Yellowish-green to light green, winged or wingless.\, \destructiveStage\=> \Leaves - Terminal leaves are curled downward and sticky with honeydew secreted by the aphids. Fruit - Honeydew may drip onto the fruit causing russet spots and promote growth of black sooty mold. Shoots - Highly infested shoots of young trees are stunted or malformed.\, \symptoms\ => \Infestations on the terminal 7-10 leaves of 50% of shoots of mature trees in a block can cause fruit damage. Inspect young bearing and non-bearing trees for increasing aphid populations and restricted tree growth.\, \care\ => \Cultural - Avoiding excessive nitrogen application will limit aphid populations by reducing succulent growth that is attractive to aphids. Biological - Predators (ladybird beetles, lacewings, syrphid flies and predatory midges) and parasitic wasps are usually capable of providing control of apple aphid on bearing trees and often on young trees. Avoid using pesticides toxic to these beneficial insects once they appear on the trees. Chemical - An application of dormant oil will kill many overwintering aphid eggs and will not affect aphid predators. Apply Alias, Admire, Assail, Thiodan, Thionex or Malathion if few predators are present, aphid populations are increasing and fruit damage appears imminent. Sprays applied before this level of aphid infestation may destroy beneficial insects and result in the need for additional sprays. Assail applied when codling moth is laying eggs will aid in codling moth control. Apply Movento when sufficient leaf tissue is present to allow for maximum uptake of the active ingredient by the plant. Movento should be applied in combination with a recommended non-ionic adjuvant (e.g. Agral 90). Movento is slow-acting so allow 12 – 18 days for noticeable decline in aphid populations. NOTE=> The sprays listed above will also control other aphids; Alias, Admire, Assail and Thiodan or Thionex will also control leafhoppers. Research shows that neonicotinoid products such as Alias, Admire and Assail may increase mite populations. Therefore do not apply more than two applications of Alias, Assail or Admire either alone or alternately per season regardless of target pest (codling moth, aphids, leafhoppers, leafminers) to avoid possible mite flare-up.\, \photourl\ => \\}
Apple Curculio: {\description\ => \Larva - Mature larvae are same size as adults, legless, white with a brown head. Adult - Small (about 5 mm long), reddish-brown weevils with long narrow snout and four small humps on their backs. They are good fliers and will drop and play dead when disturbed.\, \destructiveStage\=> \Most fruit damage occurs in the outer 2-3 rows adjacent to wild hosts such as saskatoon berries. Adult curculios feed on young pear fruit and cause the tissue around the feeding puncture to become very hard. A small pustule is often present and surrounded by a circular depression. Deformation of the fruit increases as it grows, rendering the fruit unmarketable. On cherry, females chew a very small hole in the young fruit near the stem in which they lay an egg. Infested fruit may drop prematurely or be present at harvest, making it unmarketable. Damage to apple appears as raised russeted areas (early season feeding injury) or small holes (late season feeding injury).\, \symptoms\ => \Overwinter as adults that emerge in the spring to feed on buds, fruit spurs and developing fruit. It appears they prefer to lay eggs in cherry and saskatoon as fruit inspections revealed few larvae in apple, crabapple or pear. The subsequent generation of adults appears from late July to early September when they feed on fruit before seeking overwintering sites near the host trees.\, \care\ => \Place yellow sticky traps, such as those used for cherry fruit flies, in pear blocks prior to blossom to detect adult curculios. Locate the traps in areas of previous damage. Limb taps during bloom through petal fall will also aid in detecting curculio presence. No economic threshold is available for this occasional pest. Cultural - Remove alternative food or breeding hosts such as saskatoon from areas near orchards. Chemical - No registered chemical control; however, contact insecticides applied during early petal-fall of pear will control apple curculio.\, \photourl\ => \\}

Apple Mealybug: {\description\ => \\, \destructiveStage\=> \\, \symptoms\ => \Place yellow sticky traps, such as those used for cherry fruit flies, in pear blocks prior to blossom to detect adult curculios. Locate the traps in areas of previous damage. Limb taps during bloom through petal fall will also aid in detecting curculio presence. No economic threshold is available for this occasional pest. Cultural - Remove alternative food or breeding hosts such as saskatoon from areas near orchards. Chemical - No registered chemical control; however, contact insecticides applied during early petal-fall of pear will control apple curculio.\, \care\ => \The following sprays are recommended to control the apple mealybug in cherry orchards where little cherry disease has been found, or in areas where little cherry disease is known to occur. Also refer to the Tree Fruit Production Guide and the product labels for information on application rates and safety precautions for using the insecticides listed below. Dormant=> Apply oil plus diazinon. This spray controls over-wintering nymphs. Use high volume application techniques as recommended for San Jose scale control. Petal-Fall=> Admire, Diazinon, Guthion, or Sniper used at this stage are effective against mealybugs. High volume airblast or hand gun applications are the most effective. Summer=> The major period of mealybug movement from tree to tree is during the summer when nymphs are on leaves and can be transported by wind. Nymphs are also the easiest to kill with chemicals. Low volume air blast sprays of Admire, Cygon, Lagon, Guthion, Sniper or Diazinon applied for control of cherry fruit fly are also effective for the control of apple mealybug nymphs. The closer to harvest these materials are applied, taking the minimum days before harvest into account, the more effective is the mealybug control. Movento used after petal fall is effective against mealybugs, and may be used on pome and stone fruit. Movento should be applied in combination with a recommended non-ionic adjuvant (e.g. Agral 90). Use Movento only after bees are no longer foraging. Post Harvest=> A post harvest spray of diazinon is the most effective control of nymphs on leaves, but Admire and Cygon or Lagon applied for cherry fruit fly will also provide adequate control.\, \photourl\ => \\}

Cherry Fruit Fly: {\description\ => \\, \destructiveStage\=> \\, \symptoms\ => \\, \care\ => \\, \photourl\ => \\}
Cherry Fruitworm: {\description\ => \Larva- Young larvae (caterpillars) white with a distinct black head; mature larvae 7.5 – 9 mm long with pale pink body and pale brown head and thoracic shield.  Pupa- About 6 mm long, golden brown colour, in silken cocoon. Adult- Small moth with 9 – 11 mm wing span and with dark gray and black stripes across the forewings.\, \destructiveStage\=> \Larvae feed on the flesh around the pit of cherries, and cut an exit hole to further downgrade the fruit; often distort fruit (‘monkey faced’). Feeding damage can be confused with that of cherry fruit flies, however the presence of brown pellets of frass near the pit indicate fruitworm feeding. Damage to other tree fruits has not been identified in the B.C. Interior.\, \symptoms\ => \Cherry fruitworm overwinter as larvae in small bark wounds of host trees, or more commonly in a 2.5 – 5 cm tunnel bored down the soft centre of pruning stubs. The entrance is plugged with silk. Pupation begins the following May and, depending on location, adults begin to emerge in early June, peaking in mid June, and present until mid July or later. Moths rest during the day in the tree and are active from late afternoon until dark. Single eggs are laid on the fruit, most commonly in the suture of the fruit near the tip. Eggs hatch in about 7 - 10 days and the young larvae bore into the fruit and tunnel to the pit where they develop over the next 3 weeks. Beginning late July, mature larvae leave the fruit through an exit hole and wander about the tree in search of overwintering sites. Many larvae do not exit the fruit before harvest, especially if the weather has been unseasonably cold. There is only one generation each year.\, \care\ => \Place pheromone-baited traps in orchards before moths emerge in the spring at a rate of one per hectare. At present no relationship between trap captures and potential fruit infestation is established. Because the larvae can be confused with cherry fruit fly larvae, it is important to protect the fruit from infestation beginning in early June and continuing until the fruit is harvested or until about 10 days after the last moth is captured. Cultural - Destroy infested cherries before the larvae emerge. Do not leave any unharvested unprotected fruit on the trees while adults are present. Destroy any nearby unmanaged cultivated and wild hosts. Chemical – Cherry fruitworm is an occasional pest of cherry because control products applied against spring leafrollers in early June and broad-spectrum cherry fruit fly sprays in June and July also control cherry fruitworm. However the use of products that only control cherry fruit fly may increases the risk of cherry fruitworm infestations. If the pest is present, it is recommended that more broad-spectrum products be applied against cherry fruit fly during the period of adult cherry fruitworm activity.\, \photourl\ => \\}
Codling Moth: {\description\ => \Larva - Pinkish-white caterpillar with black or mottled black head; mature larvae 12-20 mm long. Adult - Brownish-gray moth about 10-12 mm long with a copper spot on the end of each forewing.\, \destructiveStage\=> \Surface stings or holes in fruit plugged with dark masses of excreta; both types of damage allow fungi and bacteria to enter the fruit and cause fruit rot during storage.\, \symptoms\ => \Mature codling moth larvae overwinter in silken cocoons in protected sites on the tree (under loose bark, in cracks and crevices), in the soil or in wooden materials under or beside infested trees (bins, ladders, poles, buildings, large prunings). Larvae pupate in the spring and adults usually begin to emerge in early May and continue emerging until late June (mid-July in cooler areas), depending on temperature. Mating and egg-laying occur when twilight temperatures are above15°C. Females lay eggs on fruit or on leaves near fruit. Larvae usually wander over the fruit surface before cutting through the skin and boring deeply into the fruit. Mature larvae leave the fruit to pupate in protected sites on and off the tree as described above. Second generation moths appear in late July and August. Because weather during July and August is usually favourable for codling moth activity and reproduction, second-generation larvae can cause considerable damage, often close to harvest. If weather is warm during late August or early September a partial third generation may occur in southern districts.\, \care\ => \Banding - To detect and reduce larval emergence, wrap corrugated cardboard bands around tree trunks and scaffold limbs by mid-June through to the end of July. This encourages any larvae leaving the fruit to enter the cardboard bands and spin cocoons. Replace the bands applied for the first generation larvae around mid-July and burn immediately to prevent larvae from completing their development and exiting. Remove and destroy the replacement bands after harvest. In warm years with a 3rd generation, remove the summer bands at regular intervals to prevent development. Banding material is available from chemical suppliers. Fruit Removal - It is extremely important that fruit found infested with codling moth is not left on the trees at any time during the growing season. Growers should make sure that infested fruit found while thinning and picking is destroyed, in order to kill any larvae in the fruit; complete crushing of fruit is the best way to kill larvae. Culled fruit should never be dumped in orchards. If infested fruit is placed in water to drown the larvae, do not remove the apple for at least one week. Sanitation - Remove any non-commercial codling moth host trees; if on surrounding properties or public lands, inform SIR staff. Woodpiles and any wooden structures, such as fruit bins or boxes, tree props, or ladders, are important sources of overwintered codling moths. As codling moth populations decrease, it becomes important to eliminate or treat wooden structures within or immediately adjacent to the orchards. Pay attention to the source of anything wooden entering the orchard, especially wooden bins and props. Mating Disruption - Mating disruption works by preventing male moths from finding female moths for mating within blocks treated with the pheromone dispensers, Isomate-C Plus (codling moth) or Isomate CM/LR (codling moth and leafrollers) or Isomate-CM/LR TT (codling moth and leafrollers twin tubes). This control tactic is most effective when applied on an area-wide basis involving as many adjoining orchards as possible. Isomate-C Plus and Isomate CM/LR should be applied at a rate of 1000/ha (400/ac), Isomate-CM/LR TT at a rate of 750/ha (300/ac) before the first moths fly in the spring. Do not reduce the rate before consulting with the SIR program or your crop management advisor. Place the dispensers in the upper third of the canopy, preferably in shaded areas. Orchards less than 2 ha in size are not suitable for mating disruption. Growers should apply a border cover spray along edges adjacent to unmanaged sources of codling moth. Place additional dispensers in border trees to minimize the effect of immigration. Carefully read and follow the instructions provided with the dispensers. Biological - Virosoft CP4 Granulovirus - Codling moth larvae must eat the virus before they enter the fruit, so thorough coverage is essential. The efficacy of the virus deteriorates quickly (short residual period). Apply weekly in the late afternoon or on a cloudy day throughout the period when codling moth larvae are emerging from eggs. Because the granulovirus does not kill codling moth larvae as quickly as most chemical sprays, some feeding damage will occur. Store Virosoft in a cool place between uses to reduce degradation of the granulovirus. Chemical - Only apply cover sprays in those areas of the orchard where trap captures have averaged 1-2 or more moths per trap per week over 2 consecutive weeks. Use a lower threshold of 1 moth/trap for 2 consecutive weeks for Golden Delicious and high-value apple varieties. By using degree-day predictions to time the first spray, forecasting dates of codling moth egg laying and hatch is more accurate and spraying can occur when the control products can perform most effectively. Information on the approximate time of egg laying and hatch is available from most packinghouse field service offices and the SIR offices. Because the optimum timing varies among the products based on how they control codling moth, first read the product labels to become familiar with the recommended timing. Apply additional first brood and second brood sprays only after pheromone trap captures reach treatment levels and the residual protection from sprays ends. Under low-rainfall conditions, Guthion/ Sniper provides about 3 weeks protection from codling moth damage; Assail, Confirm, Intrepid, Zolone and Imidan provide about 10-14 days protection. Larvae must eat Assail, Confirm and Intrepid to be most effective so thorough coverage is essential. The following table summarizes application information on chemical pesticides recommended for codling moth control. Apply Assail, Calypso, Confirm, Intrepid, or Rimon during egg-laying (starting around 200 degree days). NOTE=> Rimon is registered for use on apples only. Use the low rate of Calypso against first brood if low to moderate infestation levels; use only the high rate for second brood. Application rates for Rimon depend on the concentration (0.93 or 1.4 L Rimon/1000 L) of the spray mixture and the spray volume applied to provide thorough coverage (minimum 700 L/ha (283 L/acre)). Consult the product label before mixing Rimon 10 EC for correct spray volume according to tree height. Apply Altacor, Assail, Delegate, Diazinon, Guthion/or Sniper, Imidan and Zolone when the degree-day total predicts that egg hatch is beginning (about 250-300 degree-days). The number of applications/ ha/season and the preharvest intervals for Guthion or Sniper depends on the rate applied (see label). Apply additional first brood and second brood sprays only after pheromone trap captures reach treatment levels and the residual protection from sprays ends. Under low-rainfall conditions, Calypso, Guthion/Sniper provides about 2-3 weeks protection from codling moth damage; Assail, Confirm, Imidan, Intrepid, Rimon and Zolone provide about 10 to 14 days protection. Larvae must eat Assail, Confirm, Intrepid,  Rimon, Altacor and Delegate to be most effective so thorough and timely coverage is essential. Research shows that application of neonicotinoid products such as Alias, Assail and Admire may cause increased mite populations. Therefore do not apply more than two applications of Alias, Assail or Admire either alone or alternately per season regardless of target pest (codling moth, aphids, leafhoppers, leafminers) to avoid mite flare-up. If Sevin is used as a thinning spray in the same block treated with Alias, Assail and/or Admire, consider monitoring mite levels. Pesticide resistance management - It is important to alternate application of insecticides from different chemical groups or with different modes of action in order to avoid development of pesticide resistance. All insecticide products have a pesticide Group number displayed on the label.\, \photourl\ => \\}

Earwigs: {\description\ => \\, \destructiveStage\=> \Although earwigs are an important predator of some pests, they can cause damage to peaches and apricots by boring into ripening and over ripened fruit. Their feeding damage to soft fruit increases the risk of brown rot infection by wind or water-borne spores and by their suspected transfer of spores as they feed. They also found hide in bagged apples where they feed upon fruit damaged by eyespotted bud moth larvae. They feed at night, and during the day they hide in cracks and crevices and under leaves and twigs next to fruit. Rolled or crumpled newspaper tucked into limb crotches is useful to monitor earwigs. Place plastic bags over the newspaper to keep it dry. Removal of debris and weed growth from the base of trees will aid in earwig control.\, \symptoms\ => \\, \care\ => \Sprays such as Sevin applied to the trunk or Sevin baits provide protection for less than one day. Success and Entrust are toxic to earwigs. Keep earwigs out of trees by wrapping a smooth part of the trunk with a 10-15 cm wide strip of duct or other adhesive tape and applying a 3-5 cm wide band of Tanglefoot or Stickum to the tape strip. Apply the sticky barrier before earwig activity is first noticed. Small boxes stuffed with crumpled paper or rolls of newspaper can be set on the ground to capture earwigs for disposal.\, \photourl\ => \\}
European Paper Wasp: {\description\ => \The following sprays are recommended to control the apple mealybug in cherry orchards where little cherry disease has been found, or in areas where little cherry disease is known to occur. Also refer to the Tree Fruit Production Guide and the product labels for information on application rates and safety precautions for using the insecticides listed below. Dormant=> Apply oil plus diazinon. This spray controls over-wintering nymphs. Use high volume application techniques as recommended for San Jose scale control. Petal-Fall=> Admire, Diazinon, Guthion, or Sniper used at this stage are effective against mealybugs. High volume airblast or hand gun applications are the most effective. Summer=> The major period of mealybug movement from tree to tree is during the summer when nymphs are on leaves and can be transported by wind. Nymphs are also the easiest to kill with chemicals. Low volume air blast sprays of Admire, Cygon, Lagon, Guthion, Sniper or Diazinon applied for control of cherry fruit fly are also effective for the control of apple mealybug nymphs. The closer to harvest these materials are applied, taking the minimum days before harvest into account, the more effective is the mealybug control. Movento used after petal fall is effective against mealybugs, and may be used on pome and stone fruit. Movento should be applied in combination with a recommended non-ionic adjuvant (e.g. Agral 90). Use Movento only after bees are no longer foraging. Post Harvest=> A post harvest spray of diazinon is the most effective control of nymphs on leaves, but Admire and Cygon or Lagon applied for cherry fruit fly will also provide adequate control.\, \destructiveStage\=> \European paper wasps can cause injury to fruits by biting skin off, spreading or fostering growth of bacteria, yeast and fungi, and can also be a nuisance to workers and pickers at harvest.\, \symptoms\ => \Fertilized queens overwinter in protected areas such as bark of dead trees, in hollow trees, under siding, in walls of unoccupied homes and begin new colonies each spring.  The queen lays an egg in each cell, feeds her young larvae with caterpillars and other insects and the young larvae mature and emerge as worker females.  Workers are responsible for food collection, nest construction and colony defense. Under favourable conditions, larvae can complete their development into the adult stage in about 40 days.\, \care\ => \Eliminate suitable nesting sites and locate and destroy any nests with queens early in the season before workers are produced.  Destruction of nests or nest sites near orchards, though tedious, might help to reduce wasp populations. There are no registered products for European paper wasps on cherries in B.C.  Wasps are not resident in orchards but move in during harvest. Sevin (carbaryl) used for the control of other pests on cherries is not very effective against European paper wasp because it has no residual effect and only a small proportion of the population is controlled. \, \photourl\ => \\}
Eyespotted Bud Moth: {\description\ => \Larva - Pale to dark chocolate brown with shiny black head; wriggle backwards and hang from silk threads like leafrollers when disturbed. Adult - Gray moths about 9 mm long with a wide white band across each forewing.\, \destructiveStage\=> \Buds - Webbed bud clusters including one or more dead leaves. Fruit - Shallow irregular skin tunnels and tiny holes under dead leaf tied to apple. Larvae will also feed on bagged apples. Damage can be confused with that of summer generation obliquebanded and threelined leafrollers but is generally less extensive.\, \symptoms\ => \This pest is common from Summerland north in the Okanagan Valley, the Fraser Valley, and the Creston Valley; damage is rare elsewhere in the Okanagan and Similkameen valleys. Young larvae overwinter in silken cocoons in the crotches of twigs and branches. They emerge near the green tip stage and construct nests of leaves and blossoms, feeding mainly on leaves. Larvae pupate in the nests and moths emerge in mid-June to late July. After mating, females lay eggs singly on leaves. Summer larvae tie dead leaves to fruit and feed on the fruit surface. In September larvae seek overwintering sites on the trees. There is one generation per year.\, \care\ => \In spring look for feeding damage to leaves and bud clusters. In late July and August examine fruit for surface feeding, usually in areas of red fruit where larvae attach a leaf or where two adjacent fruit were touching. A pheromone-baited trap is commercially available to monitor adults, however no relationship between moth captures and subsequent larval abundance has been established. For control it is important to control the spring generation of bud moth larvae in order to reduce the need to control the summer generation that causes the economic damage. Refer to the discussion under Leafrollers for additional management practices to minimize bud moth damage. Chemical - Apply Diazinon or Guthion or Sniper at pink if bud moth was a problem the previous summer. Biological insecticides Dipel, Foray or Bioprotec applied during bloom (and 10 days later if needed) will also provide control. Confirm and Intrepid applied for control of obliquebanded and threelined leafrollers in the spring or summer will aid in suppression of any bud moth and codling moth larvae present. Success/Entrust can also be used for control of bud moth larvae at petal-fall and in the summer (maximum 3 applications/ season). Success/Entrust can harm earwigs and parasitic wasps exposed to direct sprays; however there is no threat once the residues dry. Lack of insecticide applications in the spring or for second generation codling moth may require one or more sprays in July and August. This is especially true for stone fruits.\, \photourl\ => \\}
Green Fruitworms: {\description\ => \Larva - Yellowish-green to blue-green body with white to yellow longitudinal stripes and green to tan head; young larvae may have dark spots; mature larvae up to 35 mm long. Very young larvae will hang from a silk thread when disturbed; older larvae curl up when disturbed and walk without looping.\, \destructiveStage\=> \Buds - Small entry holes in buds, chewed petals and flower parts. Leaves - Chewed young terminal leaves. Fruit - Wide irregular holes in small fruit resulting in large russeted scars and deep pits in mature fruit; feeding often distorts pears.\, \symptoms\ => \\, \care\ => \Chemical - Recommended products and timing for green fruitworm control in apple are tight cluster = Diazinon + oil, Guthion or Sniper, pink=Diazinon, blossom =Dipel, Foray, or Bioprotec (Bacillus thuringiensis), petal-fall=Endosulfan, Thiodan, Dipel, Foray or Bioprotec. Note=>  Avoid using Diazinon, Guthion and Sniper as they are disruptive to pear psylla predators. These products applied at pink or petal-fall will also control other leafrollers (except resistant fruittree and obliquebanded leafrollers) and bud moth. The pink spray will also control Bruce spanworm. These materials are toxic to bees. An application of a biological insecticide containing Bacillus thuringiensis (Dipel, Foray, or Bioprotec) during bloom or at petal-fall will control green fruitworms and leafrollers and is not toxic to bees or predatory insects and mites. Best spray timing varies with species present and weather conditions. See discussion of Bacillus thuringiensis under Fruittree and European Leafrollers.\, \photourl\ => \\}

Thrips: {\description\ => \Thrips have sucking-rasping mouth parts and cause tissue damage when they feed on the leaves or fruit. Feeding on the underside of leaves results in spots or silvery/bronze patches. On fruit, damage often shows up in patches or where fruit touch each other, resulting in faint rings of scarring. They can also damage flowers. Thrips are small (<3-mm long), soft-bodied insects. Adult thrips have straw-brown bodies and four wings fringed with hairs. Nymphs are smaller, wingless and pale white in colour. Thrips are often found in the flowers, but may also be present on the underside of leaves, on fruit, or at the growing point. Plantings near greenhouse tomato, ornamental or bedding plant production are at highest risk of virus transmission.\, \destructiveStage\=> \In Ontario, both adults and nymphs overwinter on winter grains, clover and alfalfa. They migrate into vegetable fields as the weedy roadsides dry down and the winter wheat and alfalfa are harvested.\, \symptoms\ => \Although western flower thrips feed on leaves and buds and may sometimes cause seedling leaves to become distorted, their benefits aspredators of mites generally outweigh any damage they may cause. While infested seedlings may appear severely deformed, they will grow out of the damage rapidly with the onset of hot weather. In unusual seasons when cool spring weather persists into June, damage to terminals and squares may be severe, particularly in the northern cotton growing areas of the San Joaquin Valley (Merced County). In the low desert growing areas where Bt cottons are used, Delta Bt cotton appears to be more susceptible to damage by western flower thrips. Bean thrips feed on the cotton plant and may cause mature leaves to turn coppery brown or red and lower leaves to drop. Bean thrips injury may resemble spider mite injury, but affected leaves are covered with tiny black specks, which are the feces of the thrips. Usually injury is confined to field borders.\, \care\ => \There are no good management options for thrips or Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus in tomatoes. Heavy rainfall is effective in knocking thrips off the plant for a short time. No treatment is generally recommended for western flower thrips. Young plants will rapidly recover from injury. Insecticides applied to control flower thrips are usually counterproductive, as they tend to promote outbreaks of mites. Only in situations where a prolonged thrips infestation is destroying seedling terminals is treatment justified. Bean thrips outbreaks most commonly occur where there are abandoned fields or pasture areas with an abundant growth of prickly lettuce and morningglory, or field bindweed. Control of these weeds will reduce the probability of an outbreak. Spot or strip treatments may occasionally be needed; the bean thrips is controlled by most insecticides used against lygus bug\, \photourl\ => \\}
